    <h2>Browser Compatibility Testing</h2>
    <p>I have tested my website for compatibility across multiple browsers, including Edge, Chrome, Opera GX, and
        Firefox. Here are the results:</p>

    <h3>Google Chrome</h3>

    <h2>Phone Display Testing</h2>
    <p>For phone display testing, my website was reviewed on an iPhone 12 Pro to guarantee optimal responsiveness and
        user-friendliness on mobile devices. The importance of a mobile-friendly experience cannot be overstated in
        today's digital landscape.</p>

    <h2>Tablet Display Testing</h2>
    <h3>iPad Air</h3>
    <p>Tablet display testing on an iPad Air was a crucial step in providing a seamless transition from mobile to larger
        screens. It's essential to adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring that users on tablets have an enjoyable
        experience.</p>

    <h2>Color Blindness Testing</h2>
    <p>Here are two screenshots depicting how the website appears to users with color vision deficiencies:</p>

    <h3>Protanopia (Red-Green Color Blindness)</h3>

    <h2>Video with Screen Reader Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Here's a video from our website with screen reader accessibility. The video is accompanied by a transcript for
        users who rely on screen readers:</p>

    <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
        <video controls style="width: 100%;">
            <source src="Screenreader/video.m4v" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
    </div>


    <h2>HTML and CSS Validation</h2>
    <p>The validation process played a pivotal role in maintaining a well-structured website. The before-and-after
        reports highlighted the meticulous effort put into rectifying errors, enhancing code quality, and promoting
        accessibility.</p>
    <p>I conducted validation tests for my website's HTML and CSS. Here are the before and after reports:</p>

    <h3>Before Validation</h3>
    <p>Screenshot of validation errors before making changes:</p>
    <h3>Unclosed tags detected in course.html</h3>
    <img src="htmlvalidation/courses-error.png" alt="Validation Errors Before">
    <h3>Unsupported attribute detected in events.html</h3>
    <img src="htmlvalidation/events-frameborder.png" alt="Validation Errors Before">
    <h3>Empty h2 tag detected in guitar-tuner.html</h3>
    <img src="htmlvalidation/tuner-error.png" alt="Validation Errors Before">
    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">*****Errors for CSS files not found*****</h2>
    <h2>Code Corrections</h2>
    <h3>Removed Unnecessary </div> Tag</h3>
    <p>I fixed an issue where an unnecessary < / div> tag was present in the code. It has been removed to ensure proper
            HTML structure.</p>

    <h3>Removed Unsupported frameborder Attribute</h3>
    <p>I addressed an error by removing the frameborder attribute from the video section, as it is not supported in
        HTML5.</p>

    <h3>Intentional Empty H2 Placeholder</h3>
    <p>An empty h2 tag is intentionally used as a placeholder for JavaScript content. It's not an error but rather a
        design choice, as JavaScript dynamically populates it with values.</p>

<h2>After Validation</h2>

<h2>Content Readability and Accessibility Assessment</h2>
<p>I assessed the readability and accessibility of my website's content to ensure it can be easily understood and
    navigated by all users, including those with disabilities. To do this, I used the WAVE extension tool, which checks
    for accessibility issues and provides recommendations for improvement.</p>
<img src="wave/wave.png" alt="Wave tool">
<img src="wave/wave2.png" alt="Wave tool">
<p>Here are the findings from the WAVE extension tool:</p>

<ul>
    <li>3 empty buttons: The empty buttons are run by JavaScript and serve a specific purpose in the website's
        functionality.</li>
    <li>8 empty links: Although they appear empty, these links contain social media icons and are not actually empty.
        They serve as social media sharing buttons.</li>
    <li>43 contrast errors: These contrast errors are not real issues. I use a background image, and for elements that
        could be resized, I added a grey background to ensure that there are no contrast issues, thus enhancing the user
        experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, my website has undergone extensive testing to ensure usability and accessibility across various
    browsers, devices, and user scenarios. The testing process involved:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Validation of HTML and CSS to rectify errors and enhance the website's structural integrity.</li>
    <li>An assessment of content readability and accessibility using the WAVE extension tool, which identified and
        addressed several issues, including empty buttons run by JavaScript, links that contain social media icons, and
        contrast errors mitigated through careful design choices.</li>
    <li>Color blindness testing to ensure the website is accessible to users with color vision deficiencies, with
        simulations for Protanopia and Deuteranopia.</li>
    <li>A demonstration of video content with screen reader accessibility, accompanied by a transcript to assist users
        who rely on screen readers.</li>
</ul>

<p>This commitment to rigorous testing and attention to detail underscores my dedication to providing an inclusive and
    enjoyable user experience for all website visitors.</p>
